### .Obj file format for representing the definition of 3D objects

.Obj file is a geometry definition file format first developed by Wavefront Technologies. The file format is open and accepted by many 3D graphics application vendors.

The .obj file format is a simple data format that represents only three-dimensional geometry, specifically the position of each vertex, the UV of each texture coordinate vertex, vertex normals and the faces that define each polygon as a list of vertices and texture vertices. Obj coordinates have no units, but Obj files can contain scale information in a readable comment line.

The example of .obj file format:
```
  # List of geometric vertices, with (x, y, z [,w]) coordinates, w is optional and defaults to 1.0.
  v 0.123 0.234 0.345 1.0
  v ...
  ...
  # Texture coordinates (u, [,v ,w]), w is optional and default to 0.
  vt 0.500 -1.352 [0.234]
  vt ...
  ...
  # Normals (x,y,z)
  vn 0.707 0.000 0.707
  vn ...
  ...
  # Parameter space vertices (u [,v] [,w])
  vn 0.707 0.000 0.707
  vn ...
  ...
  # Polygonal face element
  f v1 v2 v3
  f ...
  ...
  # Group
  g Group1
  ...
  # Object
  o Object1
  ```

### Affine transformations

This section will describe basic affine transformations (translation, rotation, scaling) in the plane, using two-dimensional objects (images) as an example. Similarly, affine transformations can also be used for three-dimensional space.

An affine transformation is a mapping in a plane or space onto itself in which parallel lines transforms into parallel lines, intersecting lines into intersecting lines, and skew lines into skew lines.
A transformation in a plane is called affine if it is mutually unambiguous and the image of any line is a line. A transformation (mapping) is called mutually unambiguous (bijective) if it converts different points to different ones, and each point is converted to a point.

In algebraic terms, an affine transformation is a transformation of the form _f(x) = M x + v_, where _M_ is some invertible matrix and _v_ is some value.

Properties of affine transformations:
- A composition of affine transformations is an affine transformation too
- The inverse of an affine transformation is an affine transformation too
- The ratio of areas is conserved.
- The ratio of lengths of line segments is conserved.
